####Installation:
-Because of hardcoded paths, make sure the repo is cloned to
**C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\projects\first-discovery-native-host**

-Only the python host works as of now. To use it change the "path" value in
com.ibm.firstdiscovery.json to point to **python-host.bat** instead of
**host.bat**

####Usage:
Go to chrome-extension://fojfkfdnipccdhhjakieojkglomfaloe/index.html and http://extension-demo-jtworkme.mybluemix.net/
