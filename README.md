# first-discovery-native-host

####About
This native messaging host is responsible for writing GPII user tokens generated by the First Discovery
Tool to the USB drive. The First Discovery Tool sends messages to this Chrome native messaging host
via a Chrome extension, and this host in turn creates two files:

1. `.gpii-user-token.txt` - contains the user's token
2. `.first-discovery-preferences.txt` - contains the user's preference set in JSON


This repository is not useful by itself. It should be used with its companion browser extension and a first discovery server.
